# neural.h

This C++ header-only library contains a basic implementation of linear regression. It is designed only for educational purposes and is not suitable for any advanced applications.

Linear regression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, ..., wn) to minimize the average sum of distances between points in training dataset, and the values predicted by the linear approximation.
